# Data Structures Mini Project

This Java project showcases the implementation of various data structures using Java Swing for the graphical interface. The implemented data structures include Array, Stack, Queue, Circular Queue, Singly Linked List, and Doubly Linked List.

Features
Array: Basic array implementation with functionalities like insertion, deletion, and searching.
Stack: Implementation of a stack data structure with push, pop, and peek operations.
Queue: Implementation of a queue data structure with enqueue, dequeue, and peek operations.
Circular Queue: Implementation of a circular queue data structure with cyclic functionality.
Singly Linked List: Implementation of a singly linked list with insertion, deletion, and traversal operations.
Doubly Linked List: Implementation of a doubly linked list with bidirectional traversal and node manipulation.

Usage
Running from Source Code
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
Compile and run the project.

Running from JAR File
Download the DataStructuresMiniProject.jar file.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the JAR file is located.
Run the JAR file using the following command:
--> java -jar DataStructuresMiniProject.jar
Explore the graphical interface to interact with different data structures.
